1. > >> What is the technology, and what is it used for [4: KU]?

	Bioremediation is the use of microbes to clean contaminated soil and groundwater. Certain microbes naturally break down wastes
	that are harmfull to other species; these bacteria are either introduced to the contaminated environment, or such bacteria
	that already reside there are given oxygen and nutrients so that they can break down the waste at a higher rate.

	According to 'A Citizen's Guide to Bioremediation', "contaminants treated using bioremediation include oil and other
	petroleum products, solvents, and pesticides."

2. > >> What is one focused example of how gene modification is applied in relation to the topic [4: A]?

	In 1950, scientists working on methods to sterilize food, including using such methods as chemical treatment and radiation, found
	that something kept growing back after they had killed off all the bacteria on consumables. On further investigation, they found that
	it was a species of bacteria, now known as Deinococcus Radiodurans (Conan the Bacterium).

	Since then, genetic variants of this bacterium have been engineered for bioremediation, because it is capable of surviving harsh
	environmental conditions. These variants are capable of consuming radioactive ionic mercury, as well as toluene, both highly toxic substances
	(Genetic Engineering in Bioremediation). In fact, D. Radiodurans is, "the most radio-resistant organism ever known."

	b. What does the technology "look like"? Provide a diagram or construct a model depicting specific procedures
		and/or equipment [4: C].



4.      What is the impact of this technology on a social, political, environmental, and/or ethical level [8: A]?



	a. Advantages: Be thorough and specific. Explain all ideas.



	b. Disadvantages. Same as a.



5. How is the use of this technology regulated in Canada, and how does Canadian regulation of this technology
	compare to that in another country of your choice [4: I]?



	a. What are some implications of the similarities and differences in the global regulation of this technology [2: I]?



6. What is your opinion about using this technology and what action, if any, will you take [2 KU]?



	a. Support your opinion w/ at least two examples related to question 4(a - b).



7. > >> Who came up with this technology? What historical contributions that have advanced our understanding of molecular
	genetics have played a role in developing this technology? Explain [2: KU].

			What is Bioremediation?
		</h1>

		<p>
			According to <a href="http://ei.cornell.edu/biodeg/bioremed/">Environmental Inquiry</a>, bioremediation
			means to, <q>use biological organisms to solve an environmental problem</q>.
		</p>

		<p>
			Bioremediation works in one of two ways: either bacteria that can
			break down waste substances are introduced in large quantities, or pre-existing
			bacteria that can break down waste are provided food and oxygen,
			increasing the rate at which waste is broken down.
		</p>

			</p>
		</div>

		<p>
			<a href="https://clu-in.org/download/Citizens/a_citizens_guide_to_bioremediation.pdf">'A Citizen's Guide to Bioremediation'</a> tells us that,
			"contaminants treated using bioremediation include oil and other petroleum products, solvents, and pesticides."
		</p>

		<p>
			Bioremediation is a natural process, but can be augmented by humans, such as when we add oxygen and nutrients to an environment to make the microbes
			break down waste products faster, or when geneticall engineered organisms are introduced into an environment, that can break down substances naturally
			occuring organisms can't.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div name="page" class="contentBody mainGreen" id="history">
		<h1 class="heading">
			Bioremediation: A History
		</h1>

		<p>
			Bioremediation is a natural process that has been occuring for as long as there have been life and waste. It is part of the system of living things:
			take in input and output, in a manor that helps the environment heal.
		</p>

		<p>
			However, bioremediation as a technology, altered and perfected by humans, has not been around very long. The first case of bioremediation that used
			genetically modified organisms was in 1981, when the U.S. government issued a patent to Dr. Ananda Chakrabarty, for his genetically engineered <i>Pseudomonas</i>
			bacterium that could degrade oil (<a href="http://www.thenakedscientists.com/HTML/interviews/interview/1110/">The Naked Scientists</a>).
		</p>

			</p>
		</div>

		<p>
			In 1989, the oil tanker <i>Exxon Valdez</i> struck Bligh Reef in Alaska, spilling several million gallons of crude oil in the Pacific Ocean. Dr. Chakrabarty used
			this opportunity to field-test his bacterium, to great success: the genetically engineered organism proved effective at degrading the oil. However, the U.S.
			government refused to allow widespread use of the bacteria for this purpose.
		</p>

		<p>
			This creation had its foundations in Herbert Boyer's genetically engineered <i>E. coli</i> bacterium in 1978, which naturally produced insulin in large quantities.
			If this event had not occured, Dr. Chakrabarty and his team would never have known how to recombine DNA in such a way that their <i>Pseudomonas</i> variant could
			even exist.

			Life is versatile, so any process that uses life as the primary component must also be versatile. As such, although bioremediation is
			in itself a single idea, it is, in fact, a collection of different processes and technologies. Some of these are described below.

			Phytoremediation
		</h2>

		<p>
			Phytoremediation is the use of plants to remove pollutants from soild and groundwater, or to assist in degrading contaminants to a
			less toxic form. Remediation also occurs when plat roots take up toxic substances, which accumulates in their tissue. This tissue can
			then be harvested and safely processed.
		</p>

		<p>
			Bateria on the roots may also assist in remediation. When plant roots draw water up from the soil, toxic substances are drawn us as well.
			They emd up close to the surface, where there are plenty of microbes and lots of oxygen and water. The microbes, assisted by the O<sub>2</sub>
			and H<sub>2</sub>O, rapidly process down those substances into less harmful forms.
		</p>

			<img src="Bioremediation_files/Phytoremediation_diagram.jpg" class="image"/>
		</div>

		<p>
			Briefly, the categories within phytoremediation are:
		</p>

		<ul id="phytoremediationCategories">
			<li>
				<a href="http://www.hawaii.edu/abrp/Technologies/phyextr.html">Phytoextraction</a>:
				the process of using plants to remove underground contaminants and storing them in plant tissue;
			</li>

			<li>
				<a href="http://www.hawaii.edu/abrp/Technologies/phystab.html">Phytostabilization</a>:
				the immobilization of heavy metals in soil, accomplished naturally by plants, since their roots prveent wind-blown dust and soil erosion.
			</li>

			<li>
				<a href="http://www.hawaii.edu/abrp/Technologies/phystim.html">Phytostimulation</a>:
				the breakdown of organic matter by enhanced microbial activity in the rhizosphere, usually achieved through the addition of sugar or oxygen.
			</li>

			<li>
				<a href="http://www.hawaii.edu/abrp/Technologies/phytran.html">Phytotransformation</a>:
				the transformation of organic substances into other, more useful organic substances by plants.
			</li>

			<li>
				<a href="http://www.hawaii.edu/abrp/Technologies/rhizofi.html">Rhizofiltration</a>:
				using plant roots to absorb, concentrate, and precipitate toxic metals from contaminated groundwater.
			</li>

			<li>
				<a href="http://www.hawaii.edu/abrp/Technologies/constru.html">Constructed Wetlands</a>:
				man-made environments specifically designed to treat contaminated water by optimizing the natural biological, physical, and chemical
				processes that occur in natural wetlands.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h2 id="bioaugmentation">
			Bioaugmentation
		</h2>

		<p>
			Bioaugmentation is the introduction of specially selected microorganisms to an environment, with the purpose of letting them degrade the
			toxic or otherwise harmful substances there. This process, the degradation of toxic substances via specifically introduced microbes, is called
			<a href="http://www.hawaii.edu/abrp/Technologies/biodegr.html">biodegradation</a>.
		</p>

		<h2 id="biostimulation">
			Biostimulation
		</h2>

		<p>
			Biostimulation is the addition of oxygen and other inorganic nutrients to pre-existing microbial populations to induce bioremediation. When air is provided,
			it is called <a href="http://www.hawaii.edu/abrp/Technologies/biovent.html">bioventing</a>.
		</p>

		<h2 id="bioreactors">
			Bioreactors
		</h2>

		<p>
			Bioreactors are highly controlled environments where contaminated groundwater and soils are treated. By increasing the available oxygen and nutrients, and
			adjusting pH, microbial activity, and thus, bioremediation, can be optimized.
		</p>

		<p>
			The two main types of bioreactors are <a href="http://www.hawaii.edu/abrp/Technologies/cmpreac.html">compost-</a> and
			<a href="http://www.hawaii.edu/abrp/Technologies/slurry.html">slurry-based</a> reactors. Compost-based reactors involve adding large amounts of microbes
			to the contaminated soil or groundwater and increasing the temperature so that microbe metabolism increases, and toxic substances are broken down faster.
			Slurry-based bioreactors involve mixing contaminated soil with an amount of water, determined by contaminant concentration and degradation rates, and
			agitating the mixture.
		</p>

		<h2 id="land-based treatments">
			Land-Based Treatments
		</h2>

		<p>
			Land-based treatments, also known as solid-phase remediation, involves removing contaminated soil from an environment and treating it elsewhere; it is
			<i>ex situ</i>, meaning "outside its environment".
		</p>

		<p>
			Two common forms of land-based treatment are composting and <a href="http://www.hawaii.edu/abrp/Technologies/landfar.html">land farming</a>, which involves
			incorporating contaminated soil into the upper soil level, and regularly tilling this layer to aerate it.
		</p>

		<h2 id="fungal remediation">
			Fungal Remediation
		</h2>

		<div class="imageDiv floatLeft" id="whiteRotFungusImageDiv">
			<img src="Bioremediation_files/whiteRotFungus.jpeg" class="image" />
			<p class="imageCaption">
				The White Rot Fungus.
			</p>
		</div>

		<p>
			Some fungal species, particularly the <a href="http://www.hawaii.edu/abrp/Technologies/fungus.html">White Rot Fungus</a>, can degrade many organic pollutants.
			These include polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), which are officially classified carcinogens, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which can, depending
			on their structure, be highly toxic.

		<h1 class="heading">
			Genetics Involved in Bioremediation
		</h1>

		<p>
			In the 1950s, scientists working on methods to sterilize food, including using such methods as chemical treatment and radiation, found
			that something kept growing back after they had killed off all the bacteria on consumables. On further investigation, they found that
			it was a bacteria, now known as <i>Deinococcus radiodurans</i>
			(<a href="http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/1999/ast14dec99_1/">Conan the Bacterium</a>).
		</p>

		<div class="floatLeft imageDiv" id="DRadioduransImageDiv">
			<img src="Bioremediation_files/D_radiodurans.jpg" id="DRadioduransImage" class="image"/>
			<p id="DRadioduransImageCaption" class="imageCaption">A culture of <i>Deinococcus radiodurans</i>, the most radio-resistant organism ever known.</p>
		</div>

		<p>
			Since then, genetic variants of this bacterium have been engineered for bioremediation, because it is capable of surviving harsh
			environmental conditions. These variants are capable of consuming radioactive ionic mercury, as well as toluene, both highly toxic substances
			(<a href="http://www.biotecharticles.com/Environmental-Biotechnology-Article/Application-of-Genetic-Engineering-in-Bioremediation-Deinococcus-Radiodurans-2095.html">Genetic Engineering in Bioremediation</a>).
			In fact, <i>D. Radiodurans</i> is, "the most radio-resistant organism ever known."
		</p>

		<h2>
			The Role of DNA in Bioremediation
		</h2>

		<p>
			DNA shapes an organism: it gives it its charateristics and its limits. As it is such an important molecule, scientists naturally have been trying to play with
			it for a long time. By modifying the DNA in microbes, they can be granted immunities and resistances, but also weaknesses, that are different from those
			of others from their species.
		</p>

		<p>
			For example, the bacterium <i>D. Radiodurans</i> has had DNA from other microbes transplanted into it, so that it can be more useful for bioremediation. Without
			this DNA recombination, it would not be able to break down the wide variety of waste material that its genetically engineered variants can.
		</p>

		<h1 class="heading">
			The Impact of Bioremediation
		</h1>

		<h2>
			On the Environment
		</h2>

		<p>
			Bioremediation of course has an enormous impact on the environment. Man-made waste that would take years to clean instead takes months. Bioremediation
			is more effective than standard methods of waste cleaning, because the organisms that clean up depend on the waste to survive.
		</p>

		<h2>
			On the Economy
		</h2>

		<p>
			By allowing nature to clean up our messes, we save millions of dollars. Less is spent on creating new technologies to dispose of waste, because
			it can all just be given to microbes to clean up. Places that would otherwise be used as landfills can be used for buildiings, which would help the economy.
		</p>

		<h2>
			In Society
		</h2>

		<p>
			Socially, the ramifications of using genetically engineered microbes for bioremediation could be severe. For example, if a scientist creates a revolutionary
			new microbe that can break down things like polystyrene in a matter of minutes, it could create widespread panic. People will worry that it will mutate and
			start attacking the human population. This panic would cause riots, which would lead to injury and death on a large scale.

	<div name="page" class="contentBody mainGreen" id="regulation">
		<h1 class="heading">
			How Bioremediation Is Regulated
		</h1>

		<h2>
			In Canada
		</h2>

		<p>
			The use of organisms in bioremediation is regulated under the <i>Canadian Environment Protection Act</i>.
			It states that genetically engineered organisms may be used for bioremediation purposes, but only when it is absolutely certain that they
			will not harm the environment or endanger human health.
		</p>

		<h2>
			In Australia
		</h2>

		<p>
			Bioremediation is allowed if it is: (a) necessary, (b) feasible, and (c) applicable.
		</p>

		<h2>
			Implications of Global Differences in the Regulation of Bioremediation
		</h2>

		<p>
			Because bioremediation is regulated differently in different parts of the world, countries may not be able to help each other in cleaning up wastes.
			For example, the Government of Canada may not allow non-native organisms from another country to be used to clean up an oil spill, until numerous
			tests have been run. That could take years, by which time the spill could be cleaned up by hand. This difference would waste a lot of time and
			resources.
